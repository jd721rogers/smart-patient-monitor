Nurses cannot continuously monitor every patient, leaving critical events like unwitnessed falls or fever spikes undetected. To improve safety without violating privacy via cameras, this acts as a blind sensor node that tracks only physiological data (motion, heart rate, temp) to trigger alerts.



Sensors:<br><br>
● MPU6050 (Accel/Gyro): Wrist-mounted. Detects fall impacts (>3g)
and tracks activity.<br>

● MAX30102 (Pulse/Ox): Fingertip clip. Validates distress via heart
rate/SpO2.<br>

● NTC Thermistor: Wrist skin contact. Monitors continuous
temperature trends.<br><br><br>
I bought this one to try:
